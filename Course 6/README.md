In this activity, I am working for a firm that provides insights to the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional North American basketball league. I will help NBA managers and coaches identify which players are most likely to thrive in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time.  

To do this, I analyze a subset of data that contains information about NBA players and their performance records. I conduct feature engineering to determine which features will most effectively predict whether a player's NBA career will last at least five years. The insights gained then will be used in the next stage of the project: building the predictive model.
